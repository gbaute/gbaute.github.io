Crop plants are amongst our most critical technologies, especially as we are faced with climate change, a growing population, and changing diets. These crop plants are the product of millions of years of evolution, thousands of years of human selection, and decades of scientific improvement. It is my ambition to apply both established and novel genetic and genomic approaches to advance these crops further.
<br><br>
I am a Lead Scientist in breeding and genetics at Anandia Labs.	
<br><br>
Previously I was a trait geneticist with Monsanto's vegetable seed division. There, I worked with the company's vast research network and capabilities to understand important and complex traits in tomato, enabling their use in the global tomato breeding pipeline.
<br><br>
My Ph.D work focused on the domestication and improvement of sunflower.  I received my Ph.D in Botany from the University of British Columbia in 2015 for my work in Loren Rieseberg's <a href="http://rieseberglab.botany.ubc.ca">sunflower genomics lab</a>.  I developed a large number of wild introgression sunflower lines which are now being incorporated into breeding programs around the world. These lines show transgressive segregation for several key agronomic traits.
